> This repository contains the code for **ECE 412: Speech and Audio Signal Processing**, a 3-credit graduate-level course at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, covering theoretical and practical aspects of audio analysis, recognition, and synthesis.

## Speech and Audio Signal Processing
**Course, Fall 2024**  
**Instructor:** Professor Joseph Colonel

### Overview

This course provides an introduction to key topics in speech and audio processing, combining foundational theory with practical applications. It covers areas such as acoustic modeling, auditory perception, feature extraction, speech and audio recognition methods, audio transformation techniques, and synthesis methods. Students engage in short projects and a comprehensive final research project to deepen their understanding and enhance skills in coding, experimentation, and communication. The course emphasizes real-world problem-solving, exploring state-of-the-art techniques relevant to speech, music, and audio analysis.

### Material

Primary textbooks include:

- [*Speech and Audio Signal Processing: Processing and Perception of Speech and Music*](http://www.amazon.com/Speech-Audio-Signal-Processing-Perception/dp/0470195363#reader_0470195363), 2nd Edition by Ben Gold, Nelson Morgan, and Dan Ellis
- [*Introduction to Speech Processing*](https://speechprocessingbook.aalto.fi/), 2nd Edition (2022)

Key topics from these texts and related papers include:

- Auditory perception and acoustic modeling
- Speech and audio feature extraction (e.g., MFCC)
- Speech recognition techniques
- Music information retrieval and event detection
- Audio denoising and source separation
- Audio and speech synthesis methods (e.g., Vocoders, CELP, generative models)

- **Final_Project:** Machine Unlearning on Audio Classification

### Final Project

The final project, *Machine Unlearning on Audio Classification*, explores innovative methods for selectively removing learned audio features associated with specific data subsets from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Using the Free Spoken Digit Dataset, the project investigates machine unlearning techniques, such as Weight Perturbation, Selective Layer Reset, and Batch Normalization re-initialization, to address privacy concerns while maintaining overall model performance. Results demonstrate effective "forgetting" capabilities, providing valuable insights into privacy-focused audio processing applications.
